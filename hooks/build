# Advanced options for Autobuild and Autotest
# see https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced/

# Environment variables for building and testing
# Several utility environment variables are set by the build process, and are available during automated builds, automated tests, and while executing hooks.
#
#     SOURCE_BRANCH: the name of the branch or the tag that is currently being tested.
#     SOURCE_COMMIT: the SHA1 hash of the commit being tested.
#     COMMIT_MSG: the message from the commit being tested and built.
#     DOCKER_REPO: the name of the Docker repository being built.
#     DOCKERFILE_PATH: the dockerfile currently being built.
#     DOCKER_TAG: the Docker repository tag being built.
#     IMAGE_NAME: the name and tag of the Docker repository being built. (This variable is a combination of DOCKER_REPO:DOCKER_TAG.)
